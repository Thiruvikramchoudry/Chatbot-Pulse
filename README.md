# Skin Disease Diagnosis Using Images

## Abstract

Skin diseases are a widespread health concern affecting millions of individuals globally. These conditions can be caused by various factors, including fungal infections, bacterial infections, allergies, viruses, and more. The diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases are often expensive and not easily accessible to all. To address these challenges, we have developed an AI-powered system for diagnosing skin conditions using images, with a primary focus on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of dermatological assessments.

This system offers a range of features, including free chatbot consultations and affordable online doctor consultations, skin percentage prediction, skin cancer prediction, and the ability to predict the potential effects of cancer. Additionally, we have implemented robust user authentication and privacy controls to safeguard user data and ensure the security of personal health information.

## Introduction

Skin diseases are a common medical concern affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Whether caused by fungal infections, bacteria, allergies, viruses, or other factors, these conditions can be a source of discomfort, concern, and even serious health issues. Dermatological assessments and diagnoses are essential for effective treatment and management of these conditions. However, access to accurate and affordable skin disease diagnosis can be challenging.

Advancements in medical technology have made it possible to diagnose skin diseases with increased accuracy. Still, the cost of such diagnosis often remains prohibitively expensive for many individuals. To bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive solution that leverages the power of artificial intelligence and modern technologies to provide accessible and accurate skin disease diagnosis.

Our system not only diagnoses skin conditions but also offers various additional features to support users in their journey towards better skin health. These features include free chatbot consultations and affordable online doctor consultations, skin percentage prediction to assess the extent of skin conditions, skin cancer prediction using machine learning, and the ability to predict the potential effects of cancer. Moreover, we have prioritized user privacy by implementing strong user authentication and privacy controls.

This project combines a variety of technologies, including Python, Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow, Pillow, Django, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Cloudinary, to create a robust and accessible platform for skin disease diagnosis. By following the guidelines in this README, you can get started with the project and contribute to our mission of providing accessible and accurate skin health solutions.

## Features

1. **Free Chatbots and Cheap Doctor Consultations:** The system will provide free chatbot consultations and affordable online doctor consultations for users to discuss their skin concerns.

2. **Skin Percentage Prediction:** The system will analyze images of the skin and provide insights into the percentage of affected areas, helping users understand the extent of their skin condition.

3. **Skin Cancer Prediction:** Leveraging machine learning models and image analysis, the system will predict the likelihood of skin cancer based on the input images.

4. **Predicting the Effect of Cancer:** For cases where skin cancer is detected, the system will provide information about the potential effects of cancer and direct users to medical professionals for further assessment and treatment.

5. **User Authentication and Privacy:** The system will implement user authentication and robust privacy controls to protect user data and ensure the security of personal health information.
